# CEF 2024 QuantEcon Workshop

![](qe-logo-large.png)

This is the homepage for the [QuantEcon](https://quantecon.org/) scientific
and high performance computing workshop to be held at the Computational
Economics and Finance Conference at NTU  in June 2024.



## Instructor

* [John Stachurski](https://johnstachurski.net/) (Australian National University)

Bio: John Stachurski is a mathematical and computational economist who works on
algorithms at the intersection of dynamic programming, Markov dynamics,
economics, and finance.  His work is published in journals such as the Journal
of Finance, the Journal of Economic Theory, Automatica, Econometrica, and
Operations Research.  In 2016 he co-founded QuantEcon with Thomas J. Sargent. 


## Abstract

Open source scientific computing environments built around the Python
programming language have expanded rapidly in recent years. They now form the
dominant paradigm in artificial intelligence and many fields within the natural
sciences.  Economists can greatly enhance their modeling and data processing
capabilities by exploiting Python's scientific ecosystem.  This course will
cover the foundations of Python programming and Python scientific libraries, as
well as showing how they can be used in economic applications for rapid
development and high performance computing.  

## Topics

### Monday: overview and Python intro

* Hopenhayn industry model


## Dates

* May 13th - 17th

## Prerequisites

All participants should bring laptop computers.  If possible, participants
should bring laptops with the ability to install open source software. For those
without such permissions, a cloud computing option will be provided. The courses
assume knowledge of the fundamentals of linear algebra, analysis, dynamic optimization
and probability.

Suitable background can be found in the first few chapters of [Dynamic Programming](https://dp.quantecon.org).
